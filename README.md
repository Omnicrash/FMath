# FMath
A C# single-precision 3D math library

This project was created both as a learning exercise and because I needed an API-independent math framework.

It is largely based on the SlimDX math source code. Large parts of it have been ported from the C++ sources, other parts directly from (old) C# sources. Most of it has been rewritten, refactored or has been added to. Other parts have been removed.

The FMath class contains shortcuts for single precision floating-point math, and a host of useful functions.
